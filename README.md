# Angular 2 Application
![cover_photo](./img/demo.gif)

This is an Angular 2 + Bootstrap app that uses the Spotify API to search and list musical artists and albums. Users can search for:
* Song names and get a list of songs with the name that they searched for.
* Artist and get a list of songs and albums that the artist owns.
* Album and get a list of songs in that album.

This app is adapted from [1](https://github.com/bradtraversy/ngspotify) and [2](https://github.com/akashkaushik33/ngSpotify).
